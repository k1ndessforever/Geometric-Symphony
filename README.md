This new website explores a completely different artistic direction with a focus on minimalist geometric principles. Here's what makes it unique:

Structured Geometry:

A constellation of interconnected nodes arranged in a circular pattern
Dynamic lines that form between nodes based on proximity
Geometric shapes (triangles, squares, circles) that float and rotate
Concentric circles that create a sense of depth and proportion


Mathematical Interactions:

Nodes respond to cursor movement, creating ripples of motion
Lines between nodes are constantly recalculating and reforming
Clicking anywhere creates expanding geometric shapes
An underlying grid-like structure that maintains harmony


Minimalist Design Language:

Monochromatic color scheme with white elements on black background
Thin lines and subtle borders creating delicate forms
Emphasis on negative space as an active element
Clean typography with ample letter-spacing


Conceptual Exploration:

Geometric and mathematical quotes that appear when clicking
Concepts like "harmony," "balance," and "proportion" that briefly appear
The interplay between order and randomness, structure and freedom
Geometric shapes that expand and contract like breathing entities



This website creates a contemplative experience about mathematical beauty and geometric principles. Unlike the previous colorful and ethereal designs, this one embraces structure and precision while still maintaining an artistic perspective. The interactive elements invite the viewer to explore connections between points and the space between forms.
The design philosophy here draws inspiration from constructivism, mathematical art, and minimalist design principles that celebrate the beauty of geometry and proportion.
